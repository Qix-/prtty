# prTTY

Simplified Terminfo parser and a neat little wrapper/implementation of the terminfo "scripting" language.

Aims to have a similar API as [zachariahreed/pyterminfo](https://github.com/zachariahreed/pyterminfo).
There are several of these out there but they all take shortcuts or don't help you actually _use_ the
values.
